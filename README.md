You can view the flash animation [here](http://bits-oasis.org/2011/webp/).

#To Do

##Things left to be ported from Flash

- Proper Easing
- Proper Colors (I wrote my own shading function to mak object away or at an angle to be lighter while those faces facing us to be dark.)
- Resizing with screen size.
- Changing from a 3D boxes to flat rectangle once the animation is done. (Will think about the glow, though its very easy to put in CSS.)
- Testing if something can be used as a background, static or dynamic.

##Things I wish to add in the JS version

- Chosing color of boxes, color of each face, randomization.
- Getting to know what are the co-ordinates of the corners of the screen to animate from there rather than a guess.
- Changing number of columns and rows.
- Adding a link to Greensock.
